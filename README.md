7-Output Power Control Arduino Shield with sensor inputs and IR sensor

Features

1. 7 high-current (12A max) P-channel high-side MOSFETs with gate drivers. These switches have 30mOhm Rds when on. Each output has an LED indicator. 6 of the outputs are PWM controllable.

2. The shield can operate up to 30VDC and supplies this voltage to the Arduino board.

3. Two additional LEDs are connected to Arduino pin 8 and 13.

4. 3 analog inputs: 2 for photocells, 1 for user button

5. 1 IR sensor input, such as TSOP38238

6. Input voltage sense to Arduino analog input A0

7. ATO fuse holder for wire protection in case of shorts to ground.

8. Hardware design and firmware are released CC-BY-SA

Fully populated and tested board is available for $20 + shipping.  Contact holla2040@gmail.com for more information.
